# AndroidInit2016

The project is crazy enough to share the actual working in super fast way.

I do not have all the answer neither how to ask question, but here is the setup

Here is to-do list for every project u want to build

## Stage 1- You need the dev Environment

[Android Studio and Setup in Android Studios in 2016](https://github.com/cyrsis/Android-developer-Super-Tools)


[Setup Cmder](https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder)

> Shortcut to open Cmder in a chosen folder
Open a terminal as an Administrator
Navigate to the directory you have placed Cmder
Execute .\cmder.exe /REGISTER ALL If you get a message "Access Denied" ensure you are executing the command in an Administrator prompt.

[Download the theme](https://github.com/cyrsis/AndroidInit2016/blob/master/cmder/materialshell-dark.xml)

## Stage 2- Need to do some UI development




## This is my note on android development in 2016

 

All of the note will be in Q&A Style since we dont have the time to know everything

Here is some question in my mind, I need to fill them in before I do anything else

>**Q:** Why the hell we need support library in android

**A:** The project need  new features like navigation drawer (gmail),sliding menu(facebook),action bar features.All these features are available after JellyBean so if you want these type of features in (gingerbread,ics) lower versions you have to use android.supportv7 compat libraries 

>**To-Do:** Just use the new API since for the most project





软件立项及方向选择
因为自己的一个想法开始做这个项目，或者在实际开发中由产品经理立项。由于本人不会后端，所以选择的是三方开源API。
百度apistore——里面有很多可以用的API接口，有付费的也有免费的。
你也可以直接用Bmob后端云——一个强劲的后端，免去所有服务器端编码工作量
